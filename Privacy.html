          <h2>2. Types and Uses of Collected Information.</h2>
          <p>
            Company collects two types of information about you:
            <br />
            2.1 Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable
            Information is information that identifies a specific person. When
            you engage in certain activities via the Company Service, including
            but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or
            otherwise participating in the Company Service (collectively,
            “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain
            information about yourself. If you elect to engage in an
            Identification Activity we may ask you to provide us with certain
            personal information about yourself, such as your name, address
            (including zip code), email address, credit card information,
            telephone number and/or any other information you provide to us, to
            process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and
            populate forms for future transactions. When you enroll in the
            Company Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional
            information, such as credit card information. Depending on the
            Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to
            provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as
            voluntary. If you do not provide mandatory information for an
            Identification Activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that
            Identification Activity with the Company Service. Depending on the
            Identification Activity, Company might not re-ask you for Personally
            Identifiable Information if such are already stored with us. If you
            enroll in the Company Service through a third party (such as
            Facebook or Google) then Company may receive Personally Identifiable
            Information from such third party and by using the Company Service,
            you consent to such receipt of Personally Identifiable Information
            and its use pursuant to this Privacy Policy by Company.
            <br />
            We may use or share Personally Identifiable Information to provide
            products and/or services to enhance the operation of the Company
            Service, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze use
            of the Company Service, improve the Company Service, and tailor your
            experience with third parties as provided below in this Privacy
            Policy. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to
            troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks,
            contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of
            Service and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and
            cooperate with law enforcement activities.
            <br />
            2.2 Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally
            Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a
            specific person. This type of information may include things like
            the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited
            before coming to the Company Service or otherwise participating in
            the Company Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving
            the Company Service, the type of browser you are using, your
            Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile carrier information, mobile
            device information, or general and/or aggregated location data that
            does constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our
            authorized Third-Party Service Providers, may automatically collect
            this information when you visit or use the Company Service using
            electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as
            described below in this Privacy Policy. Most of the other
            information we collect for mobile, such as your mobile device
            identification and mobile device type, the request type, your mobile
            carrier, your mobile carrier user identification, and the content of
            your request, does not by itself identify you to Company, though it
            may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider
            personal. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to
            troubleshoot, administer the Company Service, analyze trends, gather
            demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate
            with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information
            with our authorized Third-Party Service Providers to measure the
            overall effectiveness of our products and services.
            <br />
            2.3 Information We Retain.
            <br />
            (a) We track and store app installation data in order to validate
            the installation process and reward relevant affiliates / traffic
            sources.

            processing is your consent or our legitimate interests, namely
            monitoring and improving our website and services.

            3.5 We may process information that you post for publication on our
            website or through our services ("publication data"). The

            data may be processed for the purposes of offering, marketing and
            selling relevant goods and/or services to you. The legal basis for
            this processing is your consent or our legitimate interests, namely
            monitoring and improving our website and services.
            <br />

            3.7 We may process information relating to transactions, including

            supplying the purchased goods and services and keeping proper
            records of those transactions. The legal basis for this processing
            is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking
            steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract and our
            legitimate interests.
